    "**Goal:**\n",
    "- Cut/segmentize a given region into vertical slices (A1, A2, A3, A4) where each resulting patch covers the same area and is separated by a strip of constant width.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:**\n",
    "- `region`... polygonal or otherwise specified region\n",
    "- `n_patches`... number of patches\n",
    "- `width_separator`... width of separation strips\n",
